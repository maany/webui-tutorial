## 📋 Tutorial Overview

This tutorial will teach you how to build features in the Rucio WebUI using Clean Architecture principles. You'll learn to:

1. **Create Secondary Output Port & Gateway** (with tests)
2. **Create a Feature** (UseCase + Controller + Presenter)
3. **Call Feature from a Page** (API Route + React Component)
4. **Design the Page** (UI Components)

**Example:** We'll build a `list-subscriptions` feature that fetches subscriptions from the Rucio server.

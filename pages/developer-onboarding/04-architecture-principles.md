## 🏗️ Key Principles

1. **Dependency Inversion**: Core layer defines interfaces (ports), infrastructure implements them
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
3. **Testability**: Mock gateways and test business logic independently
4. **Streaming Support**: Endpoints can stream NDJSON data for large datasets
